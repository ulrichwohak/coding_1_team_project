The market research team at AdRight is assigned the task to identify the profile of the typical customer for each treadmill product offered by CardioGood Fitness. The market research team decides to investigate whether there are differences across the product lines with respect to customer characteristics. The team decides to collect data on individuals who purchased a treadmill at a CardioGoodFitness retail store during the prior three months. The data are stored in the CardioGoodFitness.csv file. The team identifies the following customer variables to study: 


1. product purchased (TM195, TM498, or TM798);
2. gender;
3. age (in years);
4. education (in years);
5. relationship status;
6. annual household income (\$);
7. average number of times the customer plans to use the treadmill each week;
8. average number of miles the customers expects to walk/run each week;
9. self-rated fitness on a 1-5 scale (1 being poor, 5 being excellent shape).


Perform descriptive analytics to create a customer profile for each CardioGood Fitness treadmill product line. Note that you do not have to include a regression analysis (but you are free to do it if you think it appropriate).
